# Python_API_Challenge_VL

Part 1 of the homweork focuses on the analysis of a relationship between latitude and max temps, wind speeds, humidity, and cloudiness. The information is sourced from the open weather map with the use of an API key. The loop at the beginning of the analysis picks sample of 500 cities with the use of citipy library. 
The API and loop portion of the analysis, as well as regression and plots were sourced predominantly from class material with exception of a few searches and troubleshooting done with ChatGPT. 

Part 2 of the challenge required plotting data sources from the first part of challenge with a use of a mapping library. Majority of the information needed to complete 
the challenge could be found in part 3 of the class activities for APIs. 

Detailed source notation can be found in the code on pertinent lines.
